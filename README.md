# it202-big-project
## The title of this project is called Covid-19 Data by US States.
The goal of this project was to create a website displaying Covid-19 data among the different states in the US, in order to keep the public informed of the pandemicâ€™s statistics in America. These data points included positive cases, recovered cases, and deaths per day. 
### Technologies: 
* The coding languages used in this project were HTML and Javascript. 
* Some website components that were implemented during the building of this website were Google Charts and Materials Components. 
* A Covid tracking api was also used to import all the data into the website.
### To Run: 
* To use this project, first go to https://jpabona19.github.io/it202-big-project/#.
* On the upper left-hand corner of the page will be three lines, indicating the menu to navigate between search, table, graph, and history. 
* First you have to search for which states you want to compare data. 
* Next the table page will display columns containing data points from the states you selected. 
* The graph page will display a graph containing the data points. The history page will display a list of the states you searched previously.
